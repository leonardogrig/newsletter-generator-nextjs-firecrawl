Next-generation Xbox is being developed by Microsoft: The company, in partnership with AMD, aims to create a gaming experience that isn't restricted to a single store or device.

Since the same period in 2021, Netflix has seen a 27% increase in viewership, while YouTube grew by over 120% and accounted for 12.5% of total TV audience last month â€” the highest ever reached by a single platform.
