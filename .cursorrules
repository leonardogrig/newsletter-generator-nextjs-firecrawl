## Project Overview

- This is a Next.js project with Prisma and Tailwind CSS.
- Always use yarn to install dependencies.
- For prisma you should use the following commands:

  - yarn prisma db push
  - yarn prisma generate

- Never change the "output = "../app/generated/prisma" from the schema.prisma file.
- Never let a file get too big without modularizing it.
- Always use a nice naming approach.
- Always check the lib folder to see if the desired function wasn't already implemented.
- When implementing crud operation buttons always make that button disabled when clicked on until the result comes back to avoid multiple clicks.

- never use any "npm" command.
- no need to run "yarn dev" after a task
- no need to update the readme if not specifically asked for.
- when trying to add a component (example: yarn add @radix-ui/react-select), if it fails just stop and ask the user to install it, do not try to re-create the component.
